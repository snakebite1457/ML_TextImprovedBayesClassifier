E	"the spp81ded1 mutations were isolated as suppressors of a saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-mrna splicing mutation prp8-1 the spp81ded1 gene encodes a putative atp-dependent rna helicase while attempting to clone the wild-type spp81ded1 gene we isolated plasmids which were able to suppress the cold-sensitive growth defect of spp81 mutants these plasmids encoded a gene named dbp1 which mapped to chromosome xvi and not to the spp81ded1 locus on chromosome xv the cloned gene suppressed the defect of spp81ded1 mutants when present on both high and low copy-number plasmids but complemented spp81ded1 null mutants only when present on high copy-number plasmids in contrast to the spp81ded1 gene the dbp1 gene was not essential for cell viability the nucleotide sequence of the dbp1 gene revealed that it also encoded a putative atp-dependent rna helicase which showed considerable similarity at the amino acid level to the spp81ded1 protein"
E	"we isolated a cdna of 2001bp encoding the full-length precursor of flavoridin which is one of the four disintegrins in the venom of trimeresurus flavoviridis and analyzed the cdna nucleotide sequence the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame consisted of a pro-domain 190 residues a metalloproteinase domain 205 residues a spacer domain 18 residues and a disintegrin flavoridin domain 70 residues thus indicating that the flavoridin precursor belongs to the p-ii class of snake venom metalloproteinases the unknown metalloproteinase domain shared strong sequence similarity with hr2a 712 identity and h2-proteinase 741 identity a low molecular mass hemorrhagic metalloproteinase and a non-hemorrhagic metalloproteinase in the same snake venom respectively"
E	"arabidopsis thaliana t-dna transformants were screened for mutations affecting seed fatty acid composition a mutant line was found with reduced levels of linolenic acid 183 due to a t-dna insertion genomic dna flanking the t-dna insertion was used to obtain an arabidopsis cdna that encodes a polypeptide identified as a microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase by its complementation of the mutation analysis of lipid content in transgenic tissues demonstrated that this enzyme is limiting for 183 production in arabidopsis seeds and carrot hairy roots this cdna was used to isolate a related arabidopsis cdna whose mrna is accumulated to a much higher level in leaf tissue relative to root tissue this related cdna encodes a protein that is a homolog of the microsomal desaturase but has an n-terminal extension deduced to be a transit peptide and its gene maps to a position consistent with that of the arabidopsis fad d locus which controls plastid omega-3 desaturation these arabidopsis cdnas were used as hybridization probes to isolate cdnas encoding homologous proteins from developing seeds of soybean and rapeseed the high degree of sequence similarity between these sequences suggests that the omega-3 desaturases use a common enzyme mechanism"
E	"the 15697-nucleotide sequence of paracentrotus lividus mitochondrial dna is reported this genome codes for 2 rrnas 22 trnas and 12 mrnas which specify 13 subunits of the mitochondrial inner membrane respiratory complexes the gene arrangement differs from that of other animal species the two ribosomal genes 16 s and 12 s are separated by a stretch of about 33 kilobase pairs which contains the nd1 and nd2 genes and a cluster of 15 trna genes the nd4l coding sequence is not contained in the nd4 mrna but has its own mrna which maps between the trnaarg and the co ii genes the main noncoding region located in the trna gene cluster is only 132 nucleotides long but contains sequences homologous to the mammalian displacement loop other short noncoding sequences are interspersed in the genome they contain a conserved at consensus which probably has a role in transcription or rna processing as regards the mitochondrial genetic code the codons aga and agg specify serine and are recognized by a trna with a gcu anticodon whereas aua and aaa code for isoleucine and asparagine rather than for methionine and lysine except for nd4l which starts with auc and atpase 8 which starts with gug aug is used as the initiation codon in 11 out of 13 cases the genes terminate with the canonical stop codons uaa or uag these observations suggest that during invertebrate evolution each lineage developed its own mechanism of mitochondrial dna replication and transcription and of rna processing and translation"

B	"binding of pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pak to mucin has been shown to be mediated by the flagellar cap protein product of the flid gene since the flagellar cap is very likely an exposed structure the flid polypeptide should be recognized by the host immune system analogous to the recognition of dominant epitopes located in the exposed parts of the flagellin polypeptide within the assembled flagellum in p aeruginosa a number of distinct flagellin variants are made and these variable sequences presumably allow the newly infected p aeruginosa to escape recognition by the antibody induced during a previous infection since similar mechanisms may direct the selection of flid variants we examined the extent of sequence heterogeneity among various flid sequences among a selected group of p aeruginosa the results of pcr and nucleotide sequencing of the flid region of eight different p aeruginosa strains laboratory strains pak pao1 and pa103 clinical strains 1244 cs2 and cs32 cystic fibrosis strains cs29 and mdr suggested that there were two distinct types of flid in p aeruginosa which we named a type and b type the results of western blotting using the polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified flid of a type pak or b type pao1 further confirmed the existence of two distinct antigenic types of flid proteins with no cross-reactivity between the two serotypes further western immunoblot analysis of the same strains using polyclonal flic antibody showed that the strains with a-type flid possessed a-type flic and those with b-type flid had b-type flic similar western blot analyses of 50 more p aeruginosa strains obtained from varied sources revealed that all strains contained either a-type or b-type flid suggesting the existence of only two types of flid in p aeruginosa and indicating that flic and flid were coinherited this limited diversity of flic and flid serotypes seems to be a unique feature of flagellar proteins a chromosomal mutant having an insertion in the flid gene of p aeruginosa pao1 was constructed the motility defect of this mutant and a previously constructed pak flid mutant was better complemented with the flid gene of the homologous types"
E	"the dermatophyte fungus trichophyton exhibits unique immunologic properties by its ability to cause both immediate and delayed type hypersensitivity an 83-kda trichophyton tonsurans allergen tri t 4 was previously shown to elicit distinct t lymphocyte cytokine profiles in vitro the homologous protein tri r 4 was cloned from a trichophyton rubrum cdna library and the recombinant protein was expressed in pichia pastoris this 726-amino acid protein contained an arrangement of catalytic triad residues characteristic of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteinases ser-asp-his in addition a novel trichophyton allergen encoding 412 amino acids was identified by its human ige antibody-binding activity sequence similarity searches showed that this allergen designated tri r 2 contained all of the conserved residues characteristic of the class d subtilase subfamily 41-58 overall sequence identity forty-two percent of subjects with immediate hypersensitivity skin test reactions to a trichophyton extract exhibited ige antibody binding to a recombinant glutathione s-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 289 amino acids of tri r 2 furthermore this antigen was capable of inducing delayed type hypersensitivity skin test reactions our results define two distinct antigens derived from the dermatophyte trichophyton that serve as targets for diverse immune responses in humans"
B	"methicillin-resistance of saureus mrsa was diminished or depressed at 44 degrees c in order to investigate whether bacterial heat shock response is correlated with methicillin resistance we examined the inducibility of the heat shock proteins hsps in mrsa and cloned and sequenced of their genes a temperature shift from 37 degrees c to 46 degrees c enhanced the production of at least 8 kinds of cytoplasmic proteins as measured with two-dimensional page the induced protein profile was almost the same as methicillin sensitive saureus and stress conditions due to ethanol cadmium or low ph two of these proteins were hsp60 and hsp10 their n-terminal amino acid sequences were 79 and 83 homologous with thermobacterium ps3 respectively a positively hybridized 42 kbp dna fragment encoding both proteins was isolated from the chromosomal dna of mrsa the resulting sequence revealed two reading frames and showed high homology to those of hsp60 groel and hsp10 groes of bacteria ecoli and several other species the genes of hsp60 and hsp10 in saureus comprised an operon as in ecoli the relationship between those hsps and pbp2' is currently under investigation"
B	"bifidobacteria are gram-positive prokaryotes that naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract git and vagina although not numerically dominant in the complex intestinal microflora they are considered as key commensals that promote a healthy git we determined the 226-mb genome sequence of an infant-derived strain of bifidobacterium longum and identified 1730 possible coding sequences organized in a 60-gc circular chromosome bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacteria to the colon an unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on nondigestible plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates this ability to scavenge from a large variety of nutrients likely contributes to the competitiveness and persistence of bifidobacteria in the colon many genes for oligosaccharide metabolism were found in self-regulated modules that appear to have arisen in part from gene duplication or horizontal acquisition complete pathways for all amino acids nucleotides and some key vitamins were identified however routes for asp and cys were atypical more importantly genome analysis provided insights into the reciprocal interactions of bifidobacteria with their hosts we identified polypeptides that showed homology to most major proteins needed for production of glycoprotein-binding fimbriae structures that could possibly be important for adhesion and persistence in the git we also found a eukaryotic-type serine protease inhibitor serpin possibly involved in the reported immunomodulatory activity of bifidobacteria"
